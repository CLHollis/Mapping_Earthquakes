# Create an Interactive World Earthquake Map
### Include the following:
- past 7 days activity
- each earthquake has a pop-up with Magnitude and Location
- Multiple views that the user can toggle between:
  -   Streets
  -   Sattelite
  -   Terrain
  -   Dark
  -   Night
- Multiple views of information that can be added or removed from the map, aka overlays:
  -   All Earthquakes
  -   Tectonic Plates
  -   Major Earthquakes[only with 4.5+ magnitude]
- Add a legend (top is for Major Earthquakes, bottom is for All Earthquakes)
### Extra Finding:
By changing the opacity of the circleMarkers, you can see where the earthquake took place easier geographically, especially when zoomed-in.
